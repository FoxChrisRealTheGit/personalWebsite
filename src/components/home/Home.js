                                        Currently, I am working on my BA in Graphic Design. I have taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website was made in Dreamweaver utilizing the Bootstrap framework. Iâ€™ve also made logos, Brochures, Branding assets, and various stationary.

                                        Recently, I finished my first novel. There is one other novel being worked on as well. I have well over 200 pages of various scripts, a few plays being worked on, and a collection of short stories near completion. Most days I can average 4k words. The most that I have written in a day is near 10k.
